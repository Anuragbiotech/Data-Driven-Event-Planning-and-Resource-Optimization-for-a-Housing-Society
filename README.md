## Introduction
The housing society has provided a comprehensive dataset named "Final_Data.csv," which contains essential information about residents, flats, confirmed members, and donation details. The primary objective is to analyze this data to empower the housing society to make data-driven decisions, optimize event planning, and ensure efficient resource utilization.

## Context
In this project, we aim to analyze a dataset containing information about residents and their flats in a housing society. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the data, several data exploration and preprocessing tasks are performed. The dataset contains details about residents, their flats, and event-related information, which will be used to extract insights for organizing the grand event.

## Datasets
- **[Final_Data.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yCPlTZQVcMRuBOHdSw2X1kXPhxsCrMsA0KqRRYrSokg/edit?usp=sharing)**: Contains information about residents, their flats, confirmed members, and donation details.
- **[Decorators and Caterers Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VpRbVyq-uyLPT3b2r7HFou0WlnjpPLvmHybU4kNaTd4/edit?usp=sharing)**: Includes details about available decorators and catering services, their capacity, and costs.

## Project Goals
- **Demographic Analysis**: Understand the demographic distribution of the residents.
- **Flat Information**: Analyze flat details and their relevance to the event.
- **Resident Participation**: Examine which residents are participating in the event.
- **Owner and Tenant Information**: Distinguish between owners and tenants for targeted communication.
- **Donations Analysis**: Analyze the donations made by residents towards the event.
- **Event Planning**: Develop a strategic plan for the event based on data-driven insights.
- **Decorator and Caterer Analysis**: Evaluate decorators and caterers based on customer satisfaction and cost-effectiveness to enhance the event experience.

## Outcomes
By the end of this capstone project, you will be able to approach problem statements more logically, applying Python concepts to real-world scenarios. This project provides hands-on learning, enhancing practical problem-solving skills and proficiency in Python programming. 

The primary objective is to analyze the data to empower the housing society to make data-driven decisions, optimize event planning, and ensure efficient utilization of resources. By leveraging decorator and caterer data, we aim to enhance the event experience, minimize costs, and maximize resident satisfaction. The selection of the best caterer and decorator, based on customer satisfaction and cost-effectiveness, will play a crucial role in achieving these goals and ensuring the success of the grand event.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab (optional)
- **Version Control**: Git

## Analysis and Methodology
1. **Data Loading and Basic Overview**: Load the "Final_Data.csv" dataset and perform an initial exploration.
2. **Data Quality Checks**: Identify missing values, check data types, find unique values, and review descriptive statistics.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the demographic distribution, flat information, and resident participation patterns.
4. **Resource Optimization**: Match decorators and caterers with event needs using data-driven decision-making techniques.
5. **Visualization**: Create visual representations of key insights to aid the committee in decision-making.

## Results and Insights
- **Demographic Trends**: Insights into the age, gender, and family structure of residents.
- **Flat and Participation Analysis**: Detailed analysis of flat occupancy, ownership, and resident participation in the event.
- **Donations and Contributions**: Analysis of financial contributions from residents and their impact on event planning.
- **Vendor Selection**: Data-driven recommendations for selecting the best decorators and caterers based on satisfaction and cost-effectiveness.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of data analytics in optimizing event planning and resource allocation for a housing society. The insights derived from the analysis can significantly improve the event experience for residents while ensuring cost-effective use of resources.

## Future Work
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop models to forecast resident participation based on historical data.
- **Automated Allocation System**: Implement a system to automate the selection of decorators and caterers based on event needs.
- **Integration with Event Management Tools**: Link the analysis with event management software for real-time decision-making.
